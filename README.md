# Word_Exclusion_Algorithm
Enter a string and a dictionary (word list). Words will be excluded from the string that lie above the set frequency threshold.

This is a more methodical way than simply relying on common 'stop word' lists which are frequently too restrictive and reduce machine learning accuracy.

This is ultimately a "subsampling" algorithm based on a paper by Mikolov and Chen (2013): https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257882504_Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality
